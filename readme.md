# Sellability

A simple tool for small business owners and makers to evaluate whether a product is both **profitable** and **personally sustainable**.

#### What it does
- **Track Products**: Add products with cost and time breakdowns. Rate how much you *enjoy* each type of work.
- **Setup Scenarios**: Set time and profit goals, choose how many products to make, and see if your plan meets your targets.
- **Visual Feedback**: Charts help you balance money, time, and personal satisfaction.
